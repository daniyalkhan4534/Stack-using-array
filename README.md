# Stack-using-array

A linear data structure is called the stack. It is capable of two tasks: The PUSH and POP, PUSH functions in the code are used to add or remove elements from the top of the stack, POP function used to remove the element from the top stack.

Push operation: Adding an element to the top of the stack : adding it to the stack is known as push operation. Two steps are involved in a push operation: 1.Increment the value Top so that it can now refer to the next memory location. 2. Insert an element at the top-incremented position. Adding a new element at the top of the stack is what this is known as. When we attempt to insert an element into a fully filled stack, the stack overflows and our main function must always avoid stack overflow condition.

Pop operation: Pop operation refers to the removal of an element from a stack by removing it from the top of the stack. 1.When an element is removed from the stack, the value of the variable top is increased by 1 2. The stack's topmost element is saved in a different variable, and the top is then decremented by 1. The operation's result is the removed value that was previously saved in another variable.
